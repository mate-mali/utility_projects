# utility_projects

This repository contains source code for all kind of projects that I participated in.
Submitted code is created by myself and it is handling all kinds of daily tasks that could be simplified or automated.
Usually these are created using one of those languages:
- vba 
- Python
- and SQL query language

As those are commonly available and there is great flexibility in training, handing over, adjusting and maintenance once these are given to other person, either my friends or teammates.
Please feel free to look and be inspired, or reuse fragments of code published, however I can not take any resposibility in case they will not work in Your environment.
In case of questions please let me know by opening an issue, I will be trying to keep the communication open on that channel, accordingly to my availability.
